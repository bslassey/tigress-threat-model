1.  Introduction

   The TIGRESS Working Group is chartered
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-tigress/) to deliver a
   protocol for transferring copies of digital credentials.  The charter
   specifies certain goals:

1.1.  Privacy goals:

   *  The intermediate server should not see sensitive details of the
      Provisioning Information [Tigress-req-03]

   *  The intermediate server should not be able to provision the
      credential itself, acting as an intermediary for the recipient
      (person-in-the-middle, impersonation attack)

   *  Aside from network-level metadata, the intermediate server should
      not learn information about the sender or receiver

1.2.  Security goals:

   *  Allow for ensuring that only the intended recipient is able to
      provision the credential

   *  Allow for ensuring that the credential can only be provisioned
      once (anti-replay)

   *  Allow for ensuring that the sender has the intent to transfer
      (proof of the fact that the initiation of the credential transfer
      is attributed to a valid device and a user)

1.3.  Functional goals:

   *  Allow a sender to initiate a credential transfer and select an
      intermediary server

   *  Allow a recipient to view the transfer request with Provisioning
      Information [Tigress-req-03], and provision the credential
      information associated with it upon receipt

   *  Allow a sender and a recipient to perform multiple round trip
      communications within a limited time frame

   *  Not require that both the sender and recipient have connectivity
      to the intermediary server at the same time

   *  Support opaque message content based on the credential type

   *  Support a variety of types of credentials, to include those
      adhering to public standards (e.g., Car Connectivity Consortium)
      and proprietary (i.e., non-public or closed community) formats

   From these goals we can derive a threat model for the general problem
   space.

2.  Threat Model

2.1.  Assets and Data

2.1.1.  Credential

   A digital credential [Tigress-req-03] is composed of Cryptographic
   material and other data that enables an user to access a property.

2.1.2.  Intermediary data

   Data that is exchanged over the course of credential transfer.

2.1.3.  Credential transfer invitation

   The initial data containing Provisioning Information [Tigress-req-03]
   sent to the receiver.  It represents an invitation to accept the
   transfer of the credential.

3.  Users

3.1.  Sender

   The user who initiates the credential transfer.

3.2.  Receiver

   The user who is the intended recipient and accepts the invitation
   with the transferred credential.

3.3.  Credential Authority

   The Provisioning Entity [Tigress-req-03] that manages the lifecycle
   of a credential on a device.

5.1.  If an intermediary server is used

   Some designs may rely on an intermediary server to facilitate the
   transfer of material.  Below are threats and mitigations assuming
   that there is an intermediary server hosting encrypted content at an
   "unguessable" location.

                                 Table 2

5.2.  Mitigations.

5.2.1.  User authentication at the time of transfer initiation

   Implementers SHOULD take sufficient precautions to ensure that the
   device owner is in possession of the device when initiating a
   transfer such as requiring authentication at the time of initiation.

5.2.2.  Secret to be sent securely

   Solution should require an end-to-end encrypted messaging channel or
   otherwise specify a way to send a secret out of band.

5.2.3.  Transfer control

   Implementers should ensure any initiated attempts of credential
   transfer can be withdrawn or revoked at any time.

5.2.4.  Limited time-to-live for mailbox storage

   Limited TTL of storage, rate limiting of requests.

5.2.5.  Separation of shareURL and secret

   Separate transmission of encryption key and unguessable location.

5.2.6.  Group transfer warning

   Implementor should warn users about transferring credentials to
   groups.

5.2.7.  Encrypted mailbox content

   Content on the server is encrypted.

5.2.8.  Mailbox size limit and TTL

   Intermediary server should have tight size limits and TTLS to
   discourage misuse

6.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
